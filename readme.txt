== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will my current plugins and themes work in ClassicPress? =
If your current plugins work in WordPress 4.9.x, they will work in ClassicPress too.  If youâ€™re seeing something otherwise, thatâ€™s probably a bug with ClassicPress, and weâ€™d appreciate you reporting it on Slack or GitHub.

= Iâ€™m a developer, will I need to learn any new language or framework to develop in ClassicPress? =
Not unless you want to!  We have some exciting features planned for version 2 and beyond, but they will all be optional and fully backwards-compatible.

= I need help with something else, what should I do? =
Like all of ClassicPress, our support is a volunteer effort by the community.  If you need help with something, please join our Slack group and ask in the #support channel.
